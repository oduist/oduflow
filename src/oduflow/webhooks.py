"""GitHub push webhooks → automatic production deploys.

``POST /api/webhooks/github`` (public path, no UI session): the request is
authenticated by its ``X-Hub-Signature-256`` HMAC instead. Each team's
secret is auto-generated with its first production and doubles as the team
resolver — the signature is verified against every team's secret and the
first match wins (team counts are single digits; the cost is nil).

On a ``push`` event the matching team's productions with the same
(normalized) repo URL + branch AND ``auto_update`` enabled are deployed in
background threads via :func:`production_ops.update_production` — with its
automatic code rollback. Dev environments are NEVER touched by webhooks.

Coalescing: pushes arriving while a deploy runs queue behind the
production's lock (blocking acquire with a timeout), and at most ONE
queued run is kept — the queued deploy pulls the latest state anyway, so
N rapid pushes collapse into at most one running + one pending deploy.
