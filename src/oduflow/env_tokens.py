"""Per-environment MCP access tokens.

Each environment gets a personal token stored in the Docker label
``oduflow.mcp_token`` at creation time (see ``env_ops.create_environment``).
The token is a Bearer token authorizing the scoped MCP endpoint ``/mcp/<env>``
(single-environment access). That endpoint is Bearer-only — the OAuth flow
(client_id/secret) is wired only for the team-wide ``/mcp`` endpoint.

``resolve_token`` maps an incoming token to a ``(team_id, env_name)`` pair:

- a team ``auth_token`` from settings -> ``(team_id, None)``  [full access]
- a container's ``oduflow.mcp_token`` label -> ``(team_id, env_name)``  [scoped]

Resolution must stay cheap on the hot path: token verification runs on *every*
HTTP request, and an unauthenticated caller can spam invalid Bearer tokens at
the public endpoint. So env-token lookups are served from an in-memory cache
that is refreshed by scanning Docker at most once per ``_MIN_SCAN_INTERVAL``;
within that window unknown tokens are rejected without a rescan (implicit
negative cache), which bounds a token flood to one scan per interval. The
blocking Docker scan is offloaded to a thread by ``resolve_token_async`` so it
never stalls the event loop.
