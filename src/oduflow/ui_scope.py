"""Scoped single-environment dashboard access (``/env/<name>``).

The UI counterpart of the scoped MCP endpoint (see ``oduflow.scoped_access``
and ``specs/0028-scoped-environment-mcp-access.md``): an operator shares one
environment with a client, who gets the normal dashboard reduced to that
environment — its card, logs, dev-loop actions, consoles and Agent Chat — and
nothing else of the team.

Two pieces cooperate, both in ``web_ui``:

- the ``/env/<name>`` route exchanges a share link's ``?key=`` (verified
  against ``oduflow.env_share``) for a signed, host-only cookie and renders the
  dashboard in scoped mode;
- ``BasicAuthMiddleware`` resolves that cookie to a *scoped principal* — the
  owning team plus one environment name — and runs every subsequent request
  through :func:`is_allowed` here.

The policy is **default-deny**: a request is refused unless it matches this
table, and any env-addressed request must address the cookie's own
environment. So a scoped visitor cannot reach another environment, another
team's resources, or the team-wide surfaces (templates, services, volumes,
extra repos, credentials, productions, host stats) even by typing the URL.

Deliberately denied although the environment is theirs to work in:

- ``WS .../agent`` — **Agent CLI**. It is a PTY in the *per-team* agent
  container, whose ``/workspace`` holds a checkout of every environment of the
  team; a shell there is not confined to one environment. Agent Chat
  (``.../agent-acp``) is exposed instead: same agent, but driven over ACP at
  this environment's checkout with its scoped MCP token.
- everything that creates, destroys or re-provisions: create, delete, update,
  recreate, switch-branch, protect/unprotect, save-as-template.
