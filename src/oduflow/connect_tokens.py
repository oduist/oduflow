"""One-time, short-lived tokens for the cross-subdomain Connect As "Open" flow.

Under traefik routing an environment lives on its own host
(``<slug>.<team-host>``), so the dashboard cannot set the env's ``session_id``
cookie directly: a parent-domain cookie would *not* override a stale host-only
``session_id`` Odoo may have left on the env host (they are distinct cookies per
RFC 6265, and the older one is sent first). Instead the dashboard mints the
session, stashes the resulting ``session_id`` behind a one-time token here, and
303-redirects the browser to ``https://<env-host>/oduflow-connect?token=...``.
Traefik routes that path to Oduflow (not Odoo), which consumes the token and
sets ``session_id`` HOST-ONLY on the env host — overriding any stale cookie.

The store is in-process (the server is single-process, like ``agent_sessions``);
entries are consumed exactly once and expire after a short TTL.
