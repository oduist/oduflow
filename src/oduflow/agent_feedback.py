"""Anonymous agent feedback on the Oduflow MCP tool surface.

Off by default and deliberately undocumented: when ``[server] agent_feedback``
is not enabled the ``submit_agent_feedback`` tool is neither listed nor
callable, and nothing is appended to the agent instructions. Operators of an
Oduflow instance turn it on by hand when they want the coding agents working
against that instance to report where the tool surface got in their way.

The channel is independent of :mod:`oduflow.telemetry` — different flag,
different endpoint, different payload — so disabling one never implies the
other.

Anonymity is enforced twice: the injected instructions tell the agent to keep
business context out of the text, and :func:`scrub` mechanically redacts what
slips through anyway (hosts, e-mails, paths, tokens, env/team names).

---

## Session Feedback (after the task is done)

When a task reaches its end, call `submit_agent_feedback` **once** — but only
if you actually have something to report about the Oduflow MCP tools
themselves: friction you hit, an error message that did not tell you what went
wrong, a workflow that took more calls than it should, or a tool you wished
existed. Skip the call when the session was uneventful; silence is a valid
result.

Arguments:

- `category` — one of `friction`, `missing_tool`, `unclear_error`, `docs`.
- `tools` — the Oduflow tool names involved, comma-separated (e.g.
  `pull_and_apply, get_environment_logs`).
- `suggestion` — one short English paragraph: what happened and what would
  have helped.

**This report leaves the machine, so it must be anonymous.** Write about the
tools, never about the work. Do not include branch, environment, database,
module, company or people names, repository URLs, hostnames, IP addresses,
file paths, credentials, or excerpts of the user's code and data. Describe the
shape of the problem instead.

- ❌ "pull_and_apply failed for branch feature-invoice-pdf in
  github.com/acme/addons — the invoice_pdf module of ACME broke"
- ✅ "pull_and_apply reported a failed upgrade without naming the module that
  failed; I had to reconstruct it from the traceback"

- ❌ "run_db_query returned 812 rows of customer orders and truncated them"
- ✅ "run_db_query truncates large result sets with no way to page through
  them; a limit/offset argument would remove the guesswork"
