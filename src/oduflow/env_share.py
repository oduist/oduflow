"""Per-environment dashboard share secrets.

An operator can hand a client a link to *one* environment's dashboard —
``https://<team-host>/env/<name>?key=<secret>`` — which opens the scoped UI
described in ``oduflow.ui_scope``. This module owns the secret behind that
link.

The secret is deliberately NOT a Docker label (the model used by
``env_tokens`` for the scoped MCP endpoint): labels cannot be added to a live
container, so environments created before this feature would never be
shareable. It lives instead in a per-team registry next to ``ports.json`` and
``activity.json``:

    {"<env>": {"secret": "...", "created_at": iso}}

That keeps sharing available for existing environments, survives container
recreation, and gives the operator per-environment revoke and rotate. The file
holds credentials, so it is written 0600 (the sibling registries are 0644).

Writes follow the same concurrency discipline as those registries: a per-path
mutex for threads plus an flock for sibling processes, and a unique temp file
per write.
