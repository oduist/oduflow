"""Startup data migrations.

Odoo-style upgrade mechanism for the on-disk/Docker state Oduflow manages:
the code ships an ordered, append-only registry of one-shot migration steps,
and the data directory records which steps were already applied
(``migrations.json`` under ``base_data_dir``). On server start Oduflow diffs
the registry against the recorded state and applies only the missing steps,
oldest first.

A fresh install (no state file and no ``team_*`` data yet) is stamped as
fully applied without running anything — the same way Odoo skips migration
scripts when a module is installed from scratch rather than upgraded.

Adding a migration:

- append a :class:`Migration` to ``MIGRATIONS`` with the next sequence number
  in its id (``"0001-team-scoped-container-names"``);
- never reorder, rename, or remove existing entries — recorded ids are what
  keeps reruns idempotent on existing installs;
- make the step itself idempotent where possible: state is persisted after
  each successful step, so a step that crashed halfway is retried on the next
  start.
