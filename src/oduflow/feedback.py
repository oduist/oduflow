"""Prefilled GitHub issue links for user feedback.

Oduflow never files issues on the user's behalf: it builds a link to the
project's "new issue" form with the description and a short diagnostics block
prefilled, and the user submits it from their own GitHub account. That keeps
the report attributable to a real person, keeps Oduflow free of any GitHub
credentials, and lets the user read and edit everything before it becomes
public.

Two consequences shape this module:

* ``labels=`` is deliberately absent from the query string. GitHub rejects that
  parameter (404) for users without triage rights on the repository, so labels
  live in the issue *form* YAML (``.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/``) instead and are
  applied on submission regardless of permissions.
* The diagnostics block carries only non-identifying deployment facts — the
  same bar as the anonymous telemetry in ``telemetry.py``. No hostnames, team
  names, repository URLs, branch or database names ever go into a link.
