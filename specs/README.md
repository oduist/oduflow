# Decision records

Macro-level Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for Oduflow — the *why* behind
each architectural pillar and major capability, reconstructed from the project's
history and (going forward) written alongside the change that introduces it. See
the "Record Architectural Decisions" section in `AGENTS.md` for the convention.

Each record is `NNNN-slug.md`, ADR-style: Context · Decision · How it works
(macro) · Consequences · (Evolution) · History. Macro altitude — the reasoning a
future reader needs, not the diff.

**Numbering is chronological** by the date each decision was first made, so the
catalogue reads as the project's evolution timeline. New records take the next
number for *their* place in time; the date column below is the defining-decision
date (a record's own header carries the full commit lineage, including any
precursors).
