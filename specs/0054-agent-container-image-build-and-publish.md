# 0054 — Agent-driven container image build and publication

**Status:** Adopted
**Type:** Architecture
**First introduced:** 2026-09-01
**Key code today:** `image_builds.py`, `docker_ops/build_ops.py`, `ImageRegistrySettings` in `settings.py`, MCP tools in `server.py`, allowlist entries in `scoped_access.py`

## Context

Agents working through the scoped `/mcp/<env>` endpoint can develop, test, and
deploy Odoo code, but shipping an auxiliary-service image (a FreeSWITCH build,
a worker sidecar) still required a human with Docker and registry access. The
coder container is deliberately unprivileged — no Docker socket, no
credentials — and that boundary is worth keeping ([[0029-agent-console-and-chat]]).

An earlier, much larger design proposed per-team rootless BuildKit daemons,
packet-level egress policy, durable applied-code state woven through every
environment lifecycle operation, and a registry-aware OCI copy client.
Reviewing it, we concluded that nearly all of that complexity priced in a
hosted **multi-tenant** threat model, while Oduflow's real deployments are
single-trust-boundary: one team (or a few mutually trusting ones) on their own
server, where the agent *already* runs arbitrary code inside environment
containers on the team network. A Dockerfile `RUN` step adds no materially new
capability there. That design is summarised under "Shelved alternative" below.

## Decision

Give environment-scoped agents four MCP tools — `start_image_build`,
`get_image_build`, `publish_image_build`, `cancel_image_build` — implemented as
a thin control plane over the host Docker daemon:

- **Oduflow keeps the socket.** The agent never receives Docker access or
  registry credentials; the server builds and pushes on its behalf.
- **Config is the gate.** The tools work only for teams with a
  `[team.X.image_registry]` section; everyone else gets a clear prerequisite
  error (same pattern as `[production].enabled`). `repository_prefix` is the
  authorization boundary: agents choose any repository and any valid tag —
  including `latest` — below it. Tag naming is deliberately *not* an
  authorization layer; overwrites are last-writer-wins and auditable in the
  job's publication history.
- **The source pin is HEAD-at-admission, not applied-code state.** Under the
  existing environment lock, the managed checkout's `HEAD` commit is exported
  with `git archive` (traversal-safe extraction, size caps) into a sealed
  per-job context. The immutable git object closes the build/pull race without
  any new cross-cutting lifecycle state.
- **Build ownership follows the environment instance.** Jobs store a digest of
  the environment's persistent scoped MCP token, never the token itself. The
  digest survives an environment rename but changes on delete/recreate, so a
  reused name cannot inherit an older instance's builds.
- **The local daemon is the staging registry.** A successful build is tagged
  `oduflow-build/team-<id>:<build-id>`; publishing is `docker tag` +
  `docker push` of that exact image — promote-without-rebuild with zero
  remote-staging machinery. Destination tags are temporary local references
  removed after push; old staging tags are pruned by build age, and untagged
  image objects are removed once Docker reports that no container uses them.
- **Cleanup instead of resume.** Jobs have a bounded-concurrency monitor thread
  and a disposable worker process. The process owns the Docker HTTP connection,
  so cancellation and the wall-clock deadline can terminate even a silent
  Dockerfile step. `job.json` and a size-capped build log persist per team.
  After a restart, a job found non-terminal on disk is lazily marked
  `interrupted` on first access; succeeded builds remain publishable while
  their retained staging image exists. Retry is a new build, cheap via the
  layer cache.
- **Credentials are request-scoped.** `username` + `token` are read from the
  Oduflow config and passed per-push to the Docker API; with neither set, the
  host's own `docker login` is used. There is no daemon-wide login, and the
  credentials are not persisted in build jobs.

## Consequences

- One PR instead of four subsystems; no new daemons, no BuildKit matrix, no
  startup reconciliation pass.
- The trust model is explicit: a Dockerfile is untrusted code with the same
  reach as the team's environment containers. That is acceptable for
  self-hosted single-trust-boundary deployments and **not** for hosted
  multi-tenant ones — the shelved alternative below is the starting point if
  that ever changes.
- Registry-side enforcement matters: Oduflow validates the destination prefix,
  but the operator should still issue a least-privilege token restricted to
  that namespace.
- Multi-platform builds, build secrets, SBOMs, and a dashboard UI are out of
  scope and layer on cleanly later.

## Shelved alternative — the multi-tenant builder

Recorded because it is the design to return to if Oduflow is ever hosted for
mutually untrusting tenants. Each pillar and why it was dropped:

- **Per-team rootless BuildKit + packet-level egress policy.** Isolate the
  build from the host Docker API, the application networks, and private /
  link-local / cloud-metadata ranges, gated behind a feasibility spike across
  the supported host matrix. Dropped: it defends against a Dockerfile the
  agent could equivalently run inside its own environment container today, at
  the cost of a whole daemon topology and a per-distro security matrix.
- **Durable applied-code state.** A per-environment record of the last
  revision for which create / branch-switch / `pull_and_apply` fully succeeded,
  advanced only on success and following the environment through rename, reuse
  and deletion — so a build could never source a half-applied revision.
  Dropped: it threads new state through every lifecycle operation, and
  exporting HEAD under the environment lock closes the same race for free. The
  trade-off is real — a build can pin a commit that was pulled but whose Odoo
  actions failed — and it is the agent's job to `pull_and_apply` first.
- **Registry staging repository + digest promotion.** Push a reserved
  write-once candidate tag to the registry, record its content digest, then
  copy that digest to the requested tags with a pinned OCI client, verifying
  each tag by read-back and auditing previous/observed digests. Dropped: the
  local daemon already stores the exact built image, so `docker tag` + push is
  promote-without-rebuild with none of the remote-staging, TTL, retention, or
  copy-client machinery. What is lost is cross-writer race detection — the
  contract is last-writer-wins either way, but we no longer verify the digest a
  tag resolves to afterwards.
- **Named registry profiles.** Several credentialed registry destinations per
  team, reused for private image pulls by auxiliary services. Collapsed to one
  optional section per team; a second destination is an additive change.
- **Phased delivery (spike → single-platform → deployment integration →
  provenance/SBOM/UI).** Phases 2–3 remain a reasonable roadmap: registry auth
  for service pulls, digest-first service create/update, multi-platform builds
  behind binfmt preflight, provenance attestations, signing, and dashboard
  build history.

## History

- 2026-09-01 — introduced (simplified from a 2026-08-31 design after review;
  that document's rationale is folded into this record).
- 2026-09-02 — registry tokens moved from an environment-variable reference to
  a direct config value, matching how Oduflow stores its other deployment
  credentials while preserving request-scoped Docker authentication.
