# 0023 — Import a template from Odoo.sh via a push-based, resumable shell client

**Status:** Adopted (still in force)
**Type:** Architecture / Capability
**First introduced:** `import-from-odoosh` branch (2026-07-02)
**Key code today:** `import_tokens.py` (short-lived upload tokens), `web_ui.py` (`/import-odoo.sh` + `/api/templates/import/*` ingest endpoints, `import-token` mint), `docker_ops/system_ops.py` (`finalize_imported_template`, `extract_filestore_tar`, reusing `reload_template`), `templates/import-odoo.sh` (the client), dashboard "Import from Odoo.sh" button

## Context

Oduflow could already seed a template from a *running* Odoo via
[[0003-database-templates-and-filestore-isolation]]: `import_from_odoo` pulls a
`.zip` from `/web/database/backup` (SQL dump + filestore + manifest). That path
does not work against **Odoo.sh**, which is where many real customer databases
live. Investigation of a live Odoo.sh instance established the constraints:

- The SSH tenant role is deliberately restricted — no `pg_roles`, `pg_settings`,
  or `pg_authid` — so `pg_dump` fails at startup on **every** client version. A
  shell cannot produce its own logical dump.
- The Odoo web workers are not reachable from the SSH container (no local
  `:8069`), and `/web/database/manager` is disabled on the public URL, so the
  existing pull-based importer has nothing to talk to.
- However, on **production** builds the platform writes a ready-made daily
  backup under `~/backup.daily/<db>_daily.{sql.gz,json,/}` — a plain-SQL dump
  (already `psql`-restorable), a manifest, and the filestore tree — created by
  privileged infrastructure. This is the only complete, restorable artifact a
  shell can reach.
- The filestore is ~10 GB while free disk is often less, so no full intermediate
  archive can be staged locally: the transfer must stream.

So the direction of transport has to invert. Oduflow cannot reach *in*; the
Odoo.sh shell must push *out*.

## Decision

Add a **push-based import**: a one-line client script, fetched from the Oduflow
server and run inside the Odoo.sh shell, locates the latest daily backup and
streams it to Oduflow, which lays it out as a template and restores it through
the **existing** template machinery. Authorization is a **short-lived,
single-purpose token** minted by a dashboard button, not the UI password.

## How it works (macro)

- **Token.** The dashboard "Import from Odoo.sh" button calls a UI-authed
  endpoint that mints a random token (15 min TTL) bound to the target template
  name and returns a ready-to-paste command. The token is one JSON file per
  team carrying only auth + the target template; it is deleted on finalize or
  expiry. A stale token left in terminal scrollback is inert.
- **Staging directory + atomic swap.** Uploads land in
  `<team>/import_staging/<template>/`, never in the live template. Each
  filestore chunk is extracted into a temp sibling and renamed into staging
  only once fully unpacked, so a truncated upload can't masquerade as a
  complete chunk. `finalize` promotes the whole staged set into the template
  directory inside the overlay remount guard — re-importing over an existing
  template therefore replaces it with fresh data instead of silently
  "resuming" from the old files, and live envs never see a half-written lower
  layer.
- **Resume is disk-derived, not token-derived.** `status` reports what sits in
  the staging directory (metadata written → manifest done; `dump.sql.gz`
  present → dump done; each hash-dir present → that chunk done). Keeping
  resume state on disk rather than in the token means a fresh token minted for
  the same template — e.g. after the first expired mid-upload — still
  continues from what already landed.
- **Client (`import-odoo.sh`).** Served unauthenticated from `/import-odoo.sh`.
  It reads `$PGDATABASE`, finds `~/backup.daily/<db>_daily.*` (erroring cleanly
  if absent — daily backups exist only on production builds), resolves any
  http→https redirect up front (POST bodies must not rely on
  redirect-following), asks the server what it already has, and uploads only
  the missing pieces. Nothing large hits disk **or RAM**: the filestore is
  `tar`-streamed **per top-level hash directory** (256 dirs + `checklist`)
  via `curl -T` (chunked transfer), not `--data-binary` (which buffers the
  whole payload in memory). It prints an aggregate percentage computed from
  per-chunk sizes.
- **Ingest endpoints.** `/api/templates/import/{status,manifest,dump,filestore,
  finalize}` authenticate by token (a `Bearer` header), so they bypass Basic
  auth — as EXACT public paths, never a prefix, so sibling routes like
  `/api/templates/{name}/delete` (with `name="import"`) stay behind auth. The
  mint endpoint stays behind the UI login. `manifest` writes `metadata.json`
  (Odoo image from `odoo_branch`, module list); `dump` streams `dump.sql.gz`;
  `filestore?chunk=<hash>` unpacks one tar chunk (zip-slip guarded);
  `finalize` swaps staging into the template and runs the restore.
- **Reuse, not reinvention.** By the time `finalize` runs, the template
  directory already holds exactly what `import_from_odoo` produces
  (`dump.sql.gz` + `filestore/` + `metadata.json`), so finalize is the shared
  tail: chown the filestore, remount live overlay envs non-destructively, and
  call the unchanged `reload_template` (which already handles gzip'd plain-SQL
  dumps via `gunzip | psql`).

## Consequences

- **Resumable by construction.** Progress is read from the staged files at
  manifest / dump / per-chunk granularity, so a dropped 10 GB transfer resumes
  where it stopped instead of restarting; re-running the same command — even
  with a freshly minted token — is safe and idempotent.
- **No new dump technology.** The design rides the platform's own backup and
  Oduflow's own restore path; the only new server logic is streaming ingest +
  token auth. The restore tolerates the dump's `\restrict`/`OWNER TO` lines the
  same way it already tolerates external dumps (psql without `ON_ERROR_STOP`).
- **Production-only source.** Daily backups are kept on production builds; on
  staging/dev the client reports "backup not found" rather than inventing one.
  There is no fallback to `_manual`/`_update` backups by design (keep it
  unambiguous).
- **New public surface.** Two path families become reachable without the UI
  password (`/import-odoo.sh`, `/api/templates/import/`); they are gated instead
  by the expiring token, and the mint endpoint stays authed.

## History

- `import-from-odoosh` (2026-07-02) — push-based Odoo.sh import: `import_tokens`
  module, `/import-odoo.sh` client + `/api/templates/import/*` ingest endpoints,
  `finalize_imported_template`/`extract_filestore_tar` reusing `reload_template`,
  and the dashboard "Import from Odoo.sh" button.
