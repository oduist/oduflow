# Multi-Team Support

Oduflow supports running **multiple isolated teams** within a single server instance. Each team has its own environments, templates, services, credentials, port registry, Docker network, and PostgreSQL tablespace; the PostgreSQL and Traefik containers are the only shared infrastructure.

## Configuration

Define teams in `oduflow.toml` using `[team.*]` sections:

```toml
[team.1]
hostname = "team-a.example.com"
auth_token = "token-team-a"
ui_password = "pass-a"
port_range = [50000, 50050]

[team.2]
hostname = "team-b.example.com"
auth_token = "token-team-b"
ui_password = "pass-b"
port_range = [50050, 50100]
```

Each team gets a dedicated data directory under the base `data_dir`:

```
/srv/oduflow/
├── team_1/
│   ├── workspaces/
│   ├── templates/
│   ├── shared_repos/
│   ├── ports.json
│   ├── .git-credentials
│   └── agent_guides/
├── team_2/
│   ├── workspaces/
│   ├── templates/
│   ├── shared_repos/
│   ├── ports.json
│   ├── .git-credentials
│   └── agent_guides/
```

## Team Resolution

When an MCP tool is called, Oduflow resolves the team using the following priority:

1. **Auth token** — matches the Bearer token against `auth_token` values in team configs
2. **Host header** — matches the HTTP `Host` header against team `hostname` values
3. **Single team** — if only one team is configured, uses it automatically
4. **Default** — falls back to team `"1"`

Steps 3–4 apply to the stdio transport (implicit local single user) only. In
HTTP mode a request that matches no token and no hostname is rejected, so it
can never land in another team's context — unless `allow_insecure_http = true`
explicitly opts out (e.g. behind your own auth proxy). HTTP mode with multiple
teams also requires a non-empty `auth_token` for every team at startup.

## Quotas

Each team can carry resource quotas (`0` disables a quota):

```toml
[team.1]
db_quota_gb = 50      # default: 50
disk_quota_gb = 0     # default: 0 (off)
```

- `db_quota_gb` caps the combined size of the team's PostgreSQL databases —
  environments plus templates. It is checked before operations that create a
  *new* database (`create_environment`, `save_as_template` of a new template,
  `import_template_from_odoo`) with a single catalog query
  (`pg_database_size()`), so there is no per-file scanning in the hot path.
  Replacement operations (refresh/reload of an existing template) are not
  gated, so a team at its quota can still shrink or refresh what it has.
- `disk_quota_gb` caps the team's disk usage — its data dir (workspaces,
  filestores, template dumps) **plus** its PostgreSQL tablespace — enforced
  by the kernel via XFS project quotas. Requirements: Linux, `xfsprogs`
  installed, and the data dir on an XFS filesystem mounted with `prjquota`.
  Both directory trees get the same project ID, so one `bhard` limit covers
  files and databases together; writes beyond it fail with ENOSPC while the
  rest of the machine is unaffected. On filesystems without project-quota
  support the limit is not enforced (one warning at startup) and usage stays
  visible via the dashboard and `/api/usage`.

## Per-Team PostgreSQL Tablespaces

Each team's databases (environments and templates) live in a dedicated
PostgreSQL tablespace, `oduflow_team_{id}`, whose files sit under
`{data_dir}/pg_tablespaces/team_{id}/` on the host. Only that
`pg_tablespaces/` directory is mounted into the PostgreSQL container — never
the rest of the data dir.

This makes a team's disk consumption one visible number: assign
`team_{id}/` and `pg_tablespaces/team_{id}/` the same XFS project ID and a
single project quota covers the team's files *and* its databases. WAL stays
in the shared `PGDATA`, so a team hitting its quota gets aborted
transactions, not a server-wide outage.

Existing installs are converted automatically on server start (startup
migration `0002-team-pg-tablespaces`): the PostgreSQL container is recreated
once with the new mount (its data volume persists), then each team database
is physically moved with `ALTER DATABASE ... SET TABLESPACE`. Expect the
first start after the upgrade to take time proportional to the total
database size.

## Shared vs. Per-Team Resources

| Resource | Scope |
|---|---|
| Infra Docker network (`oduflow-net`) | Shared (PostgreSQL, Traefik) |
| Team Docker network (`oduflow-{team}-net`) | Per-team — env/service containers join only their team's network; shared infra is attached to every team network |
| PostgreSQL container (`oduflow-db`) | Shared |
| PostgreSQL tablespace (`oduflow_team_{id}`) | Per-team |
| Traefik container (`oduflow-traefik`) | Shared |
| Environments (workspaces, containers) | Per-team |
| Templates (DB snapshots, filestores) | Per-team |
| Extra addon repositories | Per-team |
| Auxiliary services | Per-team |
| Port assignments | Per-team |
| Git credentials | Per-team |

## Resource Naming

Databases and containers are namespaced by team ID:

- Environment DB: `oduflow_{team_id}_{slugified_branch}` (e.g. `oduflow_1_feature-login`)
- Template DB: `oduflow_template_{team_id}_{template_name}` (e.g. `oduflow_template_1_default`)
- Environment containers: `oduflow-{team_id}-{env}-{type}` (e.g. `oduflow-1-feature-login-odoo`)
- Service containers: `oduflow-{team_id}-svc-{name}` (e.g. `oduflow-1-svc-redis`)

Containers are additionally labeled with `oduflow.team={team_id}`; listing and
filtering are label-based, and container names are team-scoped so two teams
can use the same branch name without colliding. Containers created by older
versions are renamed to this scheme automatically on server start (startup
migration `0001-team-scoped-container-names`).

## CLI Team Selection

CLI template and service commands accept a `--team` flag:

```bash
oduflow init-template --odoo-image odoo:19.0 --template-name myproject --team 2
oduflow list-templates --team 2
oduflow cleanup --team 2
```

The default is `--team 1`.
