# Installation

## System Requirements

- **Docker** (Docker Engine or Docker Desktop)
- **Python 3.10+**
- **Git**
- **fuse-overlayfs** (Linux only, for filestore overlay mounting) — auto-installed on first launch; see below
- **rsync** (all platforms, for incremental filestore copies) — auto-installed on first launch; see below

!!! note "macOS support"
    On macOS, Docker Desktop runs containers inside a Linux VM and projects
    files via VirtioFS. **fuse-overlayfs is not needed** — filestore overlays
    are skipped and a plain directory is used instead.
    File ownership (`chown`) is handled automatically: Oduflow detects the
    `PermissionError` that VirtioFS raises and falls back to running `chown`
    inside a throwaway container. No extra configuration is required.

### Install fuse-overlayfs

On Linux, Oduflow **auto-installs `fuse-overlayfs` on first launch** if it is
missing — it runs `apt-get install -y fuse-overlayfs` when it starts as **root**
on a Debian/Ubuntu host (the Docker image already bundles it). This is
best-effort: if Oduflow is not running as root, `apt-get` is unavailable, or the
install fails, it logs a warning and you can install the package yourself:

```bash
sudo apt install fuse-overlayfs
```

The `/dev/fuse` device must be available (present by default on Ubuntu).

Oduflow mounts each environment's filestore with `fuse-overlayfs`'s `allow_other` option so the Odoo container's (non-root) user can read it. When Oduflow runs as **root** — the default and recommended setup — no further configuration is needed. Only if you run Oduflow as a **non-root user** must you uncomment `user_allow_other` in `/etc/fuse.conf`:

```bash
# Only needed when running Oduflow as a non-root user:
sudo sed -i 's/^#user_allow_other/user_allow_other/' /etc/fuse.conf
```

### Install rsync

`rsync` is auto-installed the same way on Linux (`apt-get install -y rsync` when
running as root on a Debian/Ubuntu host; the Docker image bundles it). Unlike
fuse-overlayfs it matters on **every** platform, including macOS, where it ships
with the system:

```bash
sudo apt install rsync
```

Oduflow uses it to copy only what changed. Saving an environment as a template
snapshots its filestore by hardlinking every file that already matches the
template baseline, so a multi-gigabyte filestore costs only the environment's
own deltas. Without `rsync`, publishing still works but re-copies the whole
filestore each time (logged as a warning), and syncing a template from a local
source fails outright.

## Install Oduflow

### Run without installing

With [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) you can run Oduflow directly — no installation step needed. `uvx` downloads the package into a temporary environment and runs it:

```bash
uvx oduflow                      # stdio mode (default)
uvx oduflow --transport http     # HTTP server mode
uvx oduflow -t http              # HTTP server mode (short form)
```

This is the quickest way to try Oduflow or use it in CI pipelines.

### Permanent installation

Install via [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended — manages an isolated environment automatically):

```bash
uv tool install oduflow
```

Alternative — install via pip:

```bash
pip install oduflow
```

After installation, the `oduflow` command is available globally.

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oduist/oduflow.git
cd oduflow
uv sync          # or: python -m venv .venv && pip install -e .
```

### Upgrade

```bash
uv tool upgrade oduflow
oduflow upgrade
# For unattended automation:
oduflow upgrade --force
```

The first command upgrades the Python package. The second is a separate,
interactive reconciliation of each team's deployed `odoo.conf`, agent guides,
and bundled sanitize script. Package upgrade alone does not update those
deployed copies. `postgresql.conf` is intentionally separate: preview and apply
resource-tuning changes with `oduflow retune-postgres [--apply]`.

Oduflow keeps the previous pristine bundle under
`<team-data>/.bundled_upgrade/baselines/` and performs a three-way merge. An
unmodified deployed file receives the new bundle directly; local-only changes
stay untouched; disjoint local and upstream changes are merged. The pre-update
live file is retained under `.bundled_upgrade/backups/`.

For an installation created before baselines existed, the first upgrade keeps
the live file and writes the new bundle beside it as `*.oduflow-new`. Merge that
file manually into the live file, then delete the sidecar. A true merge conflict
similarly leaves the live file untouched and writes `*.oduflow-merge`; resolve
that file, install the resolved content as the live file, and remove the
sidecar. Until the sidecar is resolved, `oduflow upgrade` exits non-zero.

For unattended upgrades, pass `--force`. It skips only the stdin confirmation:
legacy files and conflicts are still preserved and still produce a non-zero
exit code.

Automatic merging is the default. To opt a file out of all bundled changes,
add `# KEEP` as the **very first line**:

```conf
# KEEP
[options]
# Keep this odoo.conf entirely operator-managed.
...
```

Files marked with `# KEEP` are skipped and listed as `(kept)` in the upgrade
output.

## Configuration Reference

All settings are configured via a TOML file. Oduflow searches for `oduflow.toml` in the following order:

1. `ODUFLOW_TOML` environment variable (explicit path)
2. `/etc/oduflow/oduflow.toml`
3. `~/.oduflow/conf/oduflow.toml`

If no config file exists when Oduflow starts, the bundled default is copied to
`/etc/oduflow/oduflow.toml` when that directory is writable, otherwise to
`~/.oduflow/conf/oduflow.toml`. The copied file is populated with generated
values for `[database].password`, `[team.1].auth_token`, and
`[team.1].ui_password`; the generated MCP token and Web Dashboard password are
also printed in the startup log.

### Minimal configuration

```toml
[team.1]

### Server settings

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `[server].host` | `0.0.0.0` | HTTP server bind address |
| `[server].port` | `8000` | HTTP server port |
| `[server].allow_local_path` | `true` | Allow trusted local-development live-mounts that bind a host checkout read/write. Set `false` on hosted, remote, or multi-user servers, or whenever only git-clone delivery is required |
| `[server].allow_insecure_http` | `false` | Serve the `/mcp` endpoint over plain HTTP with **no** authentication. Only enable behind your own authenticating proxy |
| `[server].trace` | `false` | Enable detailed trace logging for git analysis and environment operations |
| `[server].disable_telemetry` | `false` | Disable anonymous usage telemetry (see [Telemetry](#telemetry)) |

### Routing settings

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `[routing].mode` | `port` | `port` — direct host port mapping; `traefik` — reverse proxy with auto-HTTPS |
| `[routing].acme_email` | *(empty)* | Let's Encrypt email for TLS certificates. Required when `mode = "traefik"` and `tls = true` |
| `[routing].tls` | `true` | Traefik only. `true`: Traefik terminates TLS (:443, HTTP→HTTPS redirect, Let's Encrypt). `false`: plain HTTP on :80 only, no redirect/ACME — for a TLS-terminating upstream (e.g. a Cloudflare tunnel). Public URLs stay `https://` either way |
| `[routing].hostname` | `localhost` | Default hostname for teams that don't set their own `hostname` |

### OAuth settings

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `[oauth].oauth_base_url` | *(empty)* | Public URL of this Oduflow instance used as the OAuth issuer. Oduflow runs a self-hosted OAuth 2.1 Authorization Server (exposes `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`, `/authorize`, `/token`) so OAuth-based MCP clients like Claude.ai can connect; the OAuth `client_id` is the non-secret `team_<id>` (e.g. `team_1`) and each team's `auth_token` is the `client_secret`. OAuth mints independent expiring access tokens; `auth_token` also works directly as a Bearer token. **In traefik mode this is enabled automatically and the issuer is derived per-request from each team's own hostname — leave empty.** Set it to pin a fixed issuer, or in port mode. Empty + port mode = plain Bearer-token auth only. See [Authentication & Security](security.md) |

### Database settings

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `[database].user` | `odoo` | PostgreSQL user for the shared database container |
| `[database].password` | *(generated)* | PostgreSQL password. The bundled config omits it and one is auto-generated on first launch; set explicitly to override |
| `[database].image` | `postgres:15` | PostgreSQL Docker image |

### Storage settings

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `[storage].data_dir` | `/srv/oduflow` or `~/.oduflow/data` | Base directory for all data. Team data directories are `team_{ID}` subdirectories inside |
| `[storage].overlay_threshold_mb` | `50` | Template filestore size threshold (MB). Templates smaller than this use a simple copy per environment; larger templates use fuse-overlayfs. The decision is stored in `metadata.json` at template creation time |
| `[lifecycle].auto_stop_hours` | `48` | Auto-stop environments after N hours without work (env-scoped MCP calls or dashboard actions). `0` disables. Protected environments are exempt |
| `[lifecycle].auto_delete_hours` | `0` | Auto-delete stopped environments N hours after they stopped (manual stops count). Default `0` = **disabled** — auto-delete is opt-in and destructive; set a positive value to enable. Protected environments are exempt; `pull_and_apply` wakes a stopped environment automatically |

### Agent settings

The global `[agent]` section holds deployment-wide settings for the per-team coding agent (see [Coding Agent](agent.md)). Per-team enablement lives in the `[team.*]` sections below.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `[agent].image` | `oduist/oduflow-coder:0.3.0` | Immutable image for the per-team coding-agent container (Claude Code + OpenAI Codex + OpenCode); the default is coupled to the Oduflow release |
| `[agent].claude_model` | *(empty)* | Optional Claude model override for the agent; empty = CLI default |
| `[agent].codex_model` | *(empty)* | Optional Codex model override for the agent; empty = CLI default |
| `[agent].opencode_model` | *(empty)* | Optional OpenCode model override in `provider/model` format; empty = OpenCode default |

### Production settings

Production hosting is opt-in and is documented in detail in
[Production Hosting](production.md). Production routes and the dashboard tab
are registered only when `[production].enabled = true`.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `[production].enabled` | `false` | Enable long-lived production environments and their dedicated PostgreSQL cluster. Requires Traefik routing |
| `[production].postgres_image` | *(empty)* | PostgreSQL image for the production cluster. Empty inherits `[database].image` |
| `[production].walg_version` | *(empty)* | WAL-G release override. Empty uses the version pinned by Oduflow |
| `[production].workers_cap` | `8` | Upper bound for automatically calculated Odoo workers; must be at least `1` |

### Backup settings

The `[backup]` section is optional. If it is present, `bucket`, `access_key`,
and `secret_key` are all required; remove the whole section to disable backups.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `[backup].bucket` | *(required)* | S3-compatible bucket name |
| `[backup].access_key` | *(required)* | S3 access key |
| `[backup].secret_key` | *(required)* | S3 secret key |
| `[backup].endpoint` | *(empty)* | Custom S3 endpoint for MinIO, R2, or another compatible service; enables path-style addressing |
| `[backup].region` | *(empty)* | S3 region |
| `[backup].prefix` | `oduflow` | Object-key prefix, normalized without leading or trailing `/` |
| `[backup].snapshot_time` | `02:00` | Default daily per-production snapshot time in server-local `HH:MM` |
| `[backup].basebackup_time` | `03:30` | Daily WAL-G base-backup time in server-local `HH:MM` |
| `[backup].keep` | `["30:180", "7:30", "1:7"]` | Snapshot retention tiers as `interval_days:age_days` pairs |
| `[backup].walg_keep_full` | `7` | Number of WAL-G full base backups to retain; must be at least `1` |

### Per-team settings

Each `[team.*]` section defines an isolated team with its own workspaces, templates, credentials, and services. At least one team is required.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `hostname` | `localhost` | Team hostname. In port mode: `http://{hostname}:{port}`. In traefik mode: `https://{slug}.{hostname}` |
| `environment_slots` | `20` | Traefik reusable hostname pool and concurrent environment cap. `0` keeps branch-derived hostnames; with `dev.example.com`, `N` allocates `dev1.example.com` through `devN.example.com` |
| `service_slots` | `10` | Maximum number of managed auxiliary services for the team. Stopped services count; deleting a service frees its slot. `0` disables the cap |
| `auth_token` | *(generated in fresh config)* | Bearer token for MCP HTTP auth and OAuth client secret. Empty disables MCP auth only when explicitly allowed with `[server].allow_insecure_http = true`; otherwise HTTP startup refuses it |
| `ui_password` | *(generated in fresh config)* | Password for Web UI login (user: `admin`). Separate from MCP auth token. Empty disables UI auth only when explicitly allowed with `[server].allow_insecure_http = true`; otherwise HTTP startup refuses it |
| `port_range` | `[50000, 50100]` | Port range for Odoo containers `[start, end)` — supports up to 100 concurrent environments |
| `agent_enabled` | `false` | Enable the per-team coding agent (dashboard Agent Chat / Agent CLI). Off by default |
| `agent_default` | `claude` | Which agent consoles/chats open by default: `claude`, `codex`, or `opencode` |
| `db_quota_gb` | `50` | Combined size cap for the team's environment and template PostgreSQL databases. `0` disables the check |
| `disk_quota_gb` | `0` | Kernel-enforced cap for team files and databases when the data filesystem supports XFS project quotas. `0` disables it |
| `[team.X.agent_env]` | *(empty)* | Sub-table of environment variables injected into the team's agent container — provider credentials (`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENCODE_API_KEY`, or any provider-specific OpenCode variable) and custom vars |

`environment_slots > 0` requires a hostname with a distinct host prefix and
parent domain, such as `dev.example.com`. A bare registrable domain such as
`example.com` has no prefix to number and is rejected.

Team data is stored at `{data_dir}/team_{ID}/`:

```
team_{ID}/
├── workspaces/           # Per-branch environments
├── templates/            # Reusable database snapshots
├── shared_repos/         # Extra addon repositories (bare clones)
├── ports.json            # Port registry
├── hostnames.json        # Reusable Traefik hostname reservations
├── .git-credentials      # Git credentials for this team
└── agent_guides/         # AI agent guides (markdown)
```

### Configuration file overrides

On first startup, Oduflow generates `postgresql.conf` from one host-wide
resource plan and copies the bundled `odoo.conf` if it does not exist. These
files take **priority** over the bundled defaults — edit them to customize
PostgreSQL tuning or Odoo settings globally:

```
/etc/oduflow/             (or ~/.oduflow/conf/)
  oduflow.toml            ← main configuration file
  postgresql.conf         ← dev PostgreSQL tuning (used by oduflow-db)
  postgresql-prod.conf    ← production PostgreSQL tuning (created lazily)
  odoo.conf               ← custom Odoo defaults (used by new environments)
  license.key             ← license file (optional)
  traefik/                ← Traefik dynamic configuration (auto-generated)
```

The resource plan considers `[production].enabled`. With production disabled,
the lean dev PostgreSQL profile targets about 10% of host RAM for
`shared_buffers` (128 MB–1 GB). With production enabled, the planner budgets
the host as a whole: dev PostgreSQL targets 5% (128–512 MB), production
PostgreSQL targets 20% (512 MB–8 GB), production Odoo worker sizing gets a 45%
RAM budget, and 20% stays reserved for the OS and other services. CPU values
are concurrency ceilings, not Docker reservations.

Generated configs contain an `ODUFLOW-TUNE` fingerprint. Oduflow warns when
CPU, RAM, or the production mode no longer matches that fingerprint, but never
rewrites or restarts PostgreSQL during a normal startup or package upgrade.
Preview and explicitly apply a new plan with:

```bash
oduflow retune-postgres          # plan + unified diff; writes nothing
oduflow retune-postgres --apply  # backup/write and stage managed configs
```

`--apply` refuses a custom config unless `--force` is also given. Existing
files are backed up with a UTC timestamp. For each existing production it also
regenerates the derived `odoo.conf` and stages it inside the Odoo container.
Restart the PostgreSQL and Odoo containers listed by the command to activate
the new database and worker settings.

If a repository contains an `odoo.conf` in its `.oduflow/` directory (`<repo>/.oduflow/odoo.conf`), it takes priority over both the bundled and system-level versions for that specific environment.

## Telemetry

Oduflow collects **anonymous** usage telemetry to help us understand adoption and prioritize development. Two events are sent:

- **`first_run`** — sent once on the very first startup (when the instance ID is created).
- **`env_created`** — sent each time a new environment is provisioned.

Each event contains only:

- The event name
- The oduflow version
- A random instance ID (UUID)

**No** personal data, hostnames, IP addresses, branch names, repository URLs, or environment details are collected.

### Opt out

Add to your `oduflow.toml`:

```toml
[server]
disable_telemetry = true
```

## Auto-start with systemd

On Linux servers, Oduflow can be registered as a systemd service so it starts automatically on boot.

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install uv (if not already installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install oduflow as a tool (as root)
uv tool install oduflow

# Create the configuration file (optional — Oduflow auto-creates a default oduflow.toml on first start)
```

### Install the service

```bash
oduflow systemd-install
```

This will:

1. Generate a systemd unit file at `/etc/systemd/system/oduflow.service`
2. Write `/etc/needrestart/conf.d/oduflow.conf` (only if needrestart is installed)
3. Run `systemctl daemon-reload`
4. Enable the service for auto-start on boot

The unit is ordered after `docker.service` and `containerd.service`, restarts
always, and has no start-rate limit, so a host that upgrades Docker underneath
Oduflow cannot leave the service parked in `failed`.

The needrestart snippet excludes `oduflow.service` from needrestart's automatic
restarts. Oduflow drives the Docker daemon; when `unattended-upgrades` restarts
a library, needrestart would otherwise restart Oduflow in the same batch as
containerd and Docker, and Oduflow's startup would race a daemon that is itself
going down. With the exclusion in place, needrestart lists Oduflow as needing a
manual restart instead:

```bash
systemctl restart oduflow
```

Already installed the service with an older Oduflow? Re-run
`oduflow systemd-install` to refresh the unit and add the needrestart override,
then `systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl restart oduflow`.

### Manage the service

```bash
# Start
systemctl start oduflow

# Status
systemctl status oduflow

# Logs (follow)
journalctl -u oduflow -f

# Restart after config changes
systemctl restart oduflow
```

### Remove the service

```bash
oduflow systemd-uninstall
```

This stops, disables, and removes the unit file, along with the needrestart
override.
