# Production Hosting

Oduflow can host **production** Odoo environments alongside the dev
environments it was built for. Productions get special treatment:

- a **dedicated PostgreSQL cluster** (`oduflow-prod-db`) — physically
  separate from the dev one, auto-tuned for production workloads;
- a **custom domain** per production (`erp.customer.com`), routed by Traefik
  with a Let's Encrypt certificate;
- an **auto-tuned production `odoo.conf`** (workers from host CPU/RAM, cron
  enabled, proxy mode) — never the dev profile;
- **no sanitization/neutralization**, no idle reaper, no `--dev=xml`;
- deploys with **automatic code rollback** on failure;
- **S3 backups**: continuous WAL archiving (WAL-G), scheduled snapshots
  (database dump + deduplicated filestore), disaster-recovery PITR.

Productions are managed by their own MCP tool stack (`create_production`,
`update_production`, …) and a dedicated **Production** tab in the dashboard —
they never mix with dev environment tooling.

## Requirements

- `routing_mode = "traefik"` (custom domains are Traefik `Host()` rules).
- The production's DNS record must point at the server.
- For backups: an S3-compatible bucket (AWS, MinIO, Cloudflare R2, …).
- Debian-based `postgres:*` images (the default; `-alpine` images do not run
  the WAL-G binary).

## Configuration

Everything is optional; productions themselves are created at runtime, not in
TOML:

```toml
[production]            # all keys optional
postgres_image = ""     # default: [database].image
workers_cap = 8         # upper bound for auto-tuned Odoo workers

[backup]                # presence enables the backup subsystem
bucket = "acme-backups"
access_key = "AKIA..."
secret_key = "..."
endpoint = ""           # empty = AWS; set for MinIO/R2 (path-style implied)
region = "eu-central-1"
# defaults you normally leave alone:
# prefix = "oduflow"
# snapshot_time = "02:00"      (daily per-production snapshots)
# basebackup_time = "03:30"    (daily WAL-G base backup)
# keep = ["30:180", "7:30", "1:7"]  (snapshot retention: interval:age days)
# walg_keep_full = 7           (base backups retained)
```

The production PostgreSQL cluster is provisioned lazily and idempotently: a
dev-only install never grows a second database container.

## Creating a production

```text
create_production(
    name="erp",
    repo_url="https://github.com/acme/odoo-erp.git",
    branch="production",
    domain="erp.acme.com",
    odoo_image="odoo:18.0",
    template_name="acme-prod",   # optional: seed DB+filestore from a template
    auto_update=False,
)
```

`template_name` is the migration path for an existing production: import it
first (e.g. [from Odoo.sh](templates.md)), then create the production from
that template — the database is copied into the production cluster and the
filestore into the production's plain (non-overlay) directory.

The clone is **full** (not shallow): the branch's commit history is the
production's deploy history and the source of rollback targets.

## Deploys and rollback

`update_production(name)` pulls the branch (and extra-addon worktrees),
classifies the changes (or takes explicit `install=` / `upgrade=` /
`restart=true`), applies them, and **verifies** the deploy — module exit
codes plus an in-container health check. In production a "refresh"-class
change (XML/JS only) still restarts the container: there is no `--dev=xml`.

If verification fails, the checkout is reset to the pre-deploy commit, the
config re-applied and the container restarted — **the code rolls back
automatically**. The database is *never* rolled back automatically: if a
module upgrade left it inconsistent, restore a snapshot explicitly
(`restore_production`). A snapshot is taken automatically before every deploy
when backups are configured.

Every deploy lands in the production's history (`production_deploys`):
commits, action, modules, status (`success` / `rolled_back` /
`rollback_failed`), trigger (mcp / ui / webhook / schedule).

Manual code rollback to any commit: `rollback_production(name, to_commit)`.

## GitHub webhooks (auto-deploy)

Point a GitHub webhook at `POST https://<server>/api/webhooks/github`
(content type `application/json`) with the team's webhook secret — shown in
the dashboard's Production tab, auto-generated with the first production.
Requests are authenticated by their `X-Hub-Signature-256` HMAC.

A push deploys only productions that match the repo + branch **and** have
`auto_update` enabled (`set_production_auto_update`). Dev environments are
never touched by webhooks. Failed webhook deploys roll back like any other.

## Backups

Two complementary layers (both to S3, enabled by `[backup]`):

**Snapshots — per-production restore.** A snapshot is a consistent triple:
`pg_dump` of the production database (streamed to S3, no temp disk), a
deduplicated filestore revision, and a manifest recording the deployed commit
sha. Taken daily (`snapshot_time`, per-production override via
`set_production_backup_schedule`), before every deploy, and on demand
(`snapshot_production`). Restore with:

```text
restore_production(name="erp", snapshot_id="20260711T020000Z", confirm="erp")
```

Restore is swap-based: the dump is restored into a scratch database and
swapped in by rename; the filestore is rebuilt beside the live one and
swapped in. A failed restore leaves the previous state untouched. If the
snapshot's commit differs from the checkout, the result warns you to
`rollback_production` to the matching commit.

The filestore engine (a clean-room, duplicacy-inspired content-defined
chunking store) deduplicates across daily revisions *and* across a team's
productions; retention (`keep`) is applied weekly with safe two-step fossil
collection.

**WAL-G — cluster disaster recovery.** Continuous WAL archiving plus daily
base backups of the whole production cluster. This is the "server burned
down" path:

```text
restore_cluster_pitr(target_time="", confirm="RESTORE-CLUSTER")
```

restores the **entire cluster** (every production database at once) from the
latest base backup + WAL replay — optionally to a point in time
(`target_time="2026-07-10 12:00:00+00"`). The displaced data directory is
kept inside the Docker volume for manual cleanup. Because the state lives in
S3, a **fresh Oduflow server** with the same `[backup]` section can resurrect
the cluster the same way.

`production_backup_status()` shows per-production snapshot state, WAL
archiver health (`pg_stat_archiver`), base backup inventory, and S3
reachability.

## Health

`GET /healthz` (public, no auth, no secrets) returns 200 when healthy and
503 when degraded — point your uptime monitor at it. Checks: dev PostgreSQL,
production PostgreSQL, Traefik, S3 (HeadBucket), disk usage (warn at 85%),
and productions flagged unhealthy by a failed rollback. The dashboard's
status bar shows the same checks as chips.
