# Web Dashboard & REST API

## Web Dashboard

![Web Dashboard — Agent Guides](img/agent_guides.png)

HTTP mode serves the dashboard at `/`. It manages environments, templates,
services, volumes, extra addons, credentials, licenses, usage/quotas, and—when
enabled—coding agents and productions. Environment cards also expose logs,
Odoo/SQL terminals, Connect As, notes, protection, scoped MCP access,
single-environment share links, and save-as-template actions.

The header's **Feedback** action opens a prefilled issue form on
`github.com/oduist/oduflow`. Oduflow holds no GitHub credentials and files
nothing itself: it builds the link with the description and a short
version/platform/transport block, then the user reviews and submits it from
their own GitHub account.

## Authentication and responses

Dashboard API routes use the authenticated UI session (user `admin`, password
from `[team.*].ui_password`). The login form creates an HTTP-only session
cookie; HTTP Basic credentials are also accepted. State-changing cookie-auth
requests and all WebSocket handshakes are protected by Origin/Referer checks.
This authentication is separate from MCP Bearer authentication.

Most REST handlers return JSON containing `ok`. Three public surfaces use their
own security model:

- `/healthz` is unauthenticated and contains no secrets.
- `/api/webhooks/github` verifies `X-Hub-Signature-256` against the production
  webhook secret.
- Odoo.sh import ingest routes require a short-lived Bearer import token. The
  token-minting endpoint remains UI-authenticated.

`/oduflow-connect` is a one-time, token-authenticated browser redirect rather
than a JSON API. Production routes are registered only when
`[production].enabled = true`.

## Environment endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/environments` | List environments |
| `POST` | `/api/environments/create` | Create an environment. Body: `env_name`, optional `hostname`, `repo_url`, `odoo_image`, `template_name`, `extra_addons`, `auto_install_modules`, `env_vars` (merged per key over the template's), `git_user` |
| `POST` | `/api/environments/{branch}/start` | Start an environment |
| `POST` | `/api/environments/{branch}/stop` | Stop an environment |
| `POST` | `/api/environments/{branch}/restart` | Restart its Odoo container |
| `POST` | `/api/environments/{branch}/sync` | Pull and automatically apply code changes |
| `GET` | `/api/environments/{branch}/modules` | List installed modules (name and version) — the source for the dashboard's Upgrade modules picker |
| `POST` | `/api/environments/{branch}/modules` | Install or upgrade modules. Body: `action` (`install` or `upgrade`), `modules` (comma-separated string). A successful action returns `modules_installed` or `modules_upgraded` plus `container_restarted`; if the follow-up restart fails, the module action remains successful with `container_restarted: false` plus a warning. Every result includes `modules_attempted`; a non-zero Odoo exit code omits the success field and includes the command output |
| `POST` | `/api/environments/{branch}/switch-branch` | Move the environment onto another git branch, keeping DB, filestore and URL, then apply the difference. Body: `branch`, optional `new_name` to rename the environment at the same time. The response's `env_name` is the name to address it by afterwards |
| `POST` | `/api/environments/{branch}/update` | Recreate the container while preserving DB and filestore. Optional body: `env_vars` (full replacement of the user-supplied container variables — either an object mapping names to values, or a `KEY=VALUE` string separated by newlines or commas; an empty object/string clears them, an absent key keeps them). The dashboard sends an object, so a value may contain commas, `odoo_image`, `new_name` (rename the environment; a pooled or explicit hostname is kept, its scoped MCP endpoint moves to `/mcp/<new name>`; productions and stack members are refused) |
| `GET` | `/api/environments/{branch}/env-vars` | Return the user-supplied container environment variables |
| `POST` | `/api/environments/{branch}/recreate` | Delete and recreate with the recorded parameters |
| `POST` | `/api/environments/{branch}/delete` | Delete the environment |
| `GET` | `/api/environments/{branch}/logs?n=200&container=` | Read environment logs; optionally select a container |
| `POST` | `/api/environments/{branch}/protect` | Protect from stop/delete |
| `POST` | `/api/environments/{branch}/unprotect` | Remove protection |
| `POST` | `/api/environments/{branch}/note` | Store the body `note` on the environment |
| `POST` | `/api/environments/{branch}/storage/refresh` | Refresh cached DB/workspace sizes |
| `GET` | `/api/environments/{branch}/mcp-access` | Return the scoped MCP URL and per-environment token |
| `GET` | `/api/environments/{branch}/share` | Return the environment's share link status: `shared`, `url` (with its key) and `created_at` |
| `POST` | `/api/environments/{branch}/share` | Start sharing the environment, or return the existing link |
| `POST` | `/api/environments/{branch}/share/rotate` | Issue a new link; the previous one and every session opened with it stop working |
| `POST` | `/api/environments/{branch}/share/revoke` | Stop sharing the environment |
| `GET` | `/api/environments/{branch}/users` | List internal and portal users for Connect As |
| `POST` | `/api/environments/{branch}/connect-as` | Mint an Odoo session for body `user` and return URL/cookie details |
| `GET` | `/api/environments/{branch}/connect-open?user=` | Mint a session and redirect toward the environment login handoff |
| `POST` | `/api/environments/{branch}/save-as-template` | Save the environment under body `template_name`; the UI never overwrites an existing template |

Branch parameters use Starlette's `path` converter internally, so names that
contain `/` are accepted and URL-decoded as one environment name.

The four `share` routes are operator-only: a shared session cannot read, reissue
or revoke the link it arrived on. See
[Shared environment links](#shared-environment-links).

## Shared environment links

`/env/{name}` is the same dashboard reduced to a single environment. An operator
opens **Share UI** on an environment card, which mints a link
`https://<team-host>/env/<name>?key=<secret>` and hands it to a client. Opening
it exchanges the key for an HTTP-only, SameSite=Strict cookie and redirects to
the clean `/env/<name>`, so the key leaves the address bar and browser history.
The link stays valid until it is regenerated or revoked from the same modal;
both act immediately on sessions already opened with it.

A shared session may only do the following, enforced server-side as a
default-deny allowlist (`src/oduflow/ui_scope.py`) and re-checked on every
request:

- see that environment's card, status, storage and logs;
- start, stop, restart and sync it, and install or upgrade modules;
- open its Odoo shell and `psql` consoles, use Connect As, and read its scoped
  MCP endpoint and Secret Key;
- use **Agent Chat**.

Everything else is refused with HTTP 403 (WebSockets close with 1008): the full
dashboard, any other environment, every team-wide surface (templates, services,
volumes, extra addons, credentials, productions, host statistics, license), the
provisioning actions on the shared environment itself (create, delete, update,
recreate, switch branch, protect, save as template), the share routes, and
**Agent CLI**.

Agent CLI is excluded because it is a terminal in the *per-team* agent
container, whose workspace holds a checkout of every environment of the team.
Agent Chat runs in that same container, so the scope of a shared link is a
policy boundary on the dashboard — it is not the cryptographic confinement that
the per-environment token gives on `/mcp/<env>`. Share links with people you
would let work in the environment.

## Environment WebSockets

| Protocol | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `WebSocket` | `/api/environments/{branch}/terminal` | Interactive `odoo shell` terminal |
| `WebSocket` | `/api/environments/{branch}/sql` | Interactive `psql` terminal using the environment-scoped DB role |
| `WebSocket` | `/api/environments/{branch}/agent` | Hosted Agent CLI PTY |
| `WebSocket` | `/api/environments/{branch}/agent-acp` | Hosted Agent Chat ACP relay |

## Templates and Odoo imports

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/templates` | List template profiles |
| `GET` | `/api/templates/{name:path}/metadata` | Read the complete `metadata.json` content and its optimistic revision |
| `PUT` | `/api/templates/{name:path}/metadata` | Validate and atomically replace `metadata.json`; body: `content`, `revision` |
| `POST` | `/api/templates/{name}/delete` | Delete a template |
| `POST` | `/api/templates/{name}/rename` | Rename it; body: `new_name` |
| `POST` | `/api/templates/import-from-odoo` | UI-authenticated: pull a backup from a running Odoo. Body: `odoo_url`, `master_pwd`, `template_name`, optional `db_name`, optional boolean `without_filestore` |
| `POST` | `/api/templates/import-token` | UI-authenticated: mint a 15-minute Odoo.sh import token |
| `GET` | `/api/templates/import/status` | Import-token authenticated: report resumable upload progress |
| `POST` | `/api/templates/import/manifest` | Upload template metadata |
| `POST` | `/api/templates/import/dump` | Stream/chunk the compressed SQL dump |
| `POST` | `/api/templates/import/filestore` | Upload one atomic filestore hash-directory archive |
| `POST` | `/api/templates/import/addon` | Stream/chunk one private addon archive |
| `POST` | `/api/templates/import/addon-remote` | Register an addon repo that the server can clone |
| `POST` | `/api/templates/import/finalize` | Validate staged data and atomically publish/restore the template |
| `GET` | `/import-odoo.sh` | Download the token-authenticated Odoo.sh import client |

The pull-import endpoint accepts HTTP and HTTPS source URLs. HTTP sends the Odoo
master password without transport encryption, so HTTPS remains recommended.
Loopback, link-local, metadata, and private-network targets remain blocked by
the outbound URL safety check.

Odoo.sh ingest endpoints accept the import token only in
`Authorization: Bearer ...`, not in the URL. See
[Template Management](templates.md) for the supported import workflow.

## Services, PostgreSQL databases, presets, and volumes

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/services` | List services |
| `POST` | `/api/services/create` | Create a service with either catch-all `port` or restricted Traefik `routes`, plus optional image/runtime settings. `command` accepts a shell-quoted string or an argv array and replaces the image `CMD` |
| `GET` | `/api/services/{name}/env-vars` | Return the environment variables an update keeps — the saved preset, or the container's own environment for a service created before presets |
| `POST` | `/api/services/{name}/update` | Pull/change settings and recreate safely; `env_vars`, `volumes`, and `routes` are full replacements when supplied. Omit `command` to keep it, send `""`/`[]` to fall back to the image `CMD` |
| `POST` | `/api/services/{name}/restart` | Restart a service |
| `POST` | `/api/services/{name}/delete` | Delete a service |
| `GET` | `/api/services/{name}/logs?n=200` | Read service logs |
| `GET` | `/api/service-databases` | List managed sidecar databases without passwords |
| `POST` | `/api/service-databases/create` | Create a database and scoped role; body: `name` |
| `POST` | `/api/service-databases/{name}/credentials` | Explicitly reveal connection credentials and `DATABASE_URL` |
| `POST` | `/api/service-databases/{name}/rotate` | Rotate the database role password |
| `POST` | `/api/service-databases/{name}/delete` | Permanently drop the database and role, terminating connections |
| `GET` | `/api/service-presets` | List saved presets |
| `POST` | `/api/service-presets/restore` | Restore a preset; body: `name` plus optional runtime overrides |
| `POST` | `/api/service-presets/{name}/delete` | Delete a preset |
| `GET` | `/api/volumes` | List managed volumes and service usage |
| `POST` | `/api/volumes/create` | Create a volume; body: `name`, optional `description` |
| `POST` | `/api/volumes/{name}/delete` | Delete an unused volume |

Service databases live in the shared development PostgreSQL cluster, inside the
current team's tablespace. They have a dedicated non-superuser owner and persist
independently of service containers. Bridge-mode services reach them through
the returned PostgreSQL container hostname; host-network services are not
supported because the cluster is not published on a host port.

## Extra addons and credentials

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/extra-repos` | List extra-addon repositories |
| `POST` | `/api/extra-repos/add` | Add one; body: `name`, `repo_url`, optional `git_user` |
| `POST` | `/api/extra-repos/{name}/pull` | Fetch remote changes |
| `POST` | `/api/extra-repos/{name}/protect` | Protect from deletion |
| `POST` | `/api/extra-repos/{name}/unprotect` | Remove protection |
| `POST` | `/api/extra-repos/{name}/delete` | Delete the repository and unused cached revisions |
| `GET` | `/api/credentials` | List stored credential identities (not secrets) |
| `POST` | `/api/credentials/add` | Store credentials embedded in body `repo_url` |
| `POST` | `/api/credentials/delete` | Delete by body `host` and `username` |

| `POST` | `/api/feedback/link` | Build a prefilled `github.com/oduist/oduflow` issue URL. Body: required `details`; optional `kind` (`bug`, `feature`, or `feedback`) and `title` |
| `GET` | `/api/agent-guides` | List available agent guides |
| `GET` | `/api/agent-guides/{filename}` | Read a guide |

## Coding agent endpoints

These endpoints and the WebSocket surfaces are useful only for teams with
`agent_enabled = true`; the dashboard hides agent actions for live-mounted
environments.

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/agent` | Agent enablement and effective default (`claude`, `codex`, or `opencode`) |
| `GET` | `/api/environments/{branch}/agent-acp/info?type=` | ACP working directory, selected/recent sessions, and attachment limits |
| `POST` | `/api/environments/{branch}/agent-acp/session` | Select, title, or clear the current session for body `type` |
| `POST` | `/api/environments/{branch}/agent-acp/attachments?name=` | Stream an attachment into the agent checkout |
| `DELETE` | `/api/environments/{branch}/agent-acp/attachments/{upload_id}` | Delete an unsent attachment |

## Production endpoints

These routes exist only when production hosting is enabled. Destructive restore
and delete operations require explicit confirmation in their JSON body.

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/productions` | List productions and return webhook/backup state |
| `POST` | `/api/productions/create` | Create a production from repository/image/domain settings, optionally a template |
| `GET` | `/api/productions/backup-status` | Team backup, WAL-G, base-backup, and S3 health |
| `GET` | `/api/productions/{name}` | Detailed production information |
| `POST` | `/api/productions/{name}/start` | Start |
| `POST` | `/api/productions/{name}/stop` | Stop |
| `POST` | `/api/productions/{name}/restart` | Restart |
| `POST` | `/api/productions/{name}/update` | Start an asynchronous deploy; returns `202` |

| `POST` | `/api/productions/{name}/auto-update` | Set body `enabled` for webhook deploys |
| `GET` | `/api/productions/{name}/logs?lines=200` | Read up to 2,000 log lines |
| `GET` | `/api/productions/{name}/deploys` | Read recent deploy history |
| `POST` | `/api/productions/{name}/delete` | Delete; body `confirm` must equal name, optional `drop_database` |
| `GET` | `/api/productions/{name}/snapshots?refresh=true` | List S3 snapshots, optionally bypassing cache |
| `POST` | `/api/productions/{name}/snapshot` | Take a snapshot now |
| `POST` | `/api/productions/{name}/restore` | Restore body `snapshot_id`; body `confirm` must equal name |
| `POST` | `/api/productions/{name}/backup-schedule` | Set body `schedule` to `HH:MM` or `off` |
| `POST` | `/api/webhooks/github` | Public HMAC-authenticated GitHub push webhook |

See [Production Hosting](production.md) for deploy, rollback, backup, and PITR
semantics.

## Browser routes

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/` | Dashboard application |
| `GET`, `POST` | `/login` | UI login form |
| `POST` | `/logout` | Clear the UI session |
| `GET` | `/oduflow-connect?token=` | One-time environment-host login handoff; sets Odoo `session_id` and redirects to `/web` |
| `GET` | `/favicon.ico`, `/logo.png`, `/static/{filename}` | Packaged dashboard assets |
