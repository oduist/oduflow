# MCP Tools Reference

![Agent Instructions](img/agent_instructions.png)

All tools are accessible via MCP clients (Cursor, Cline, Amp, etc.) and the CLI (`oduflow call`). A subset is also available via the [REST API](web-api.md).

| Tool | Lock | Description |
|---|:---:|---|
| **Environment Management** | | |
| `create_environment` | ✓ | Provision an Odoo environment for a branch (clone, DB, container, filestore); optional `env_vars` injects container environment variables |
| `delete_environment` | ✓ | Tear down all resources for a branch |
| `list_environments` | | List all managed environments with status and URLs |
| `get_environment_info` | | Full environment details: DB name, URL, repo, image, template, extra addons, workspace, container status, CPU/RAM stats |
| `start_environment` | | Start a stopped environment |
| `stop_environment` | | Stop a running environment |
| `restart_environment` | | Restart the Odoo container |
| `update_environment` | ✓ | Re-create the container, preserving DB and filestore; optional `odoo_image` switches the image and `env_vars` replaces the container environment variables |
| **Odoo Operations** | | |
| `pull_and_apply` | ✓ | Git pull + smart analysis → auto install/upgrade/restart |
| `install_odoo_modules` | ✓ | Install Odoo modules (`-i`) |
| `upgrade_odoo_modules` | ✓ | Upgrade Odoo modules (`-u`) |
| `export_module_translations` | ✓ | Export a module's `.pot`/`.po` with Odoo's own exporter, write it into the module's `i18n/`, and return a summary plus an HTTP download URL or local temporary path |
| `translation_status` | ✓ | Compare a module's terms, database translations and committed `.po` files, including the sibling-POT metadata merge Odoo performs before import |
| `run_odoo_tests` | ✓ | Run Odoo tests for specific modules; `test_tags` narrows the run to one class or method, `upgrade=False` skips the `-u` for a fast re-run (collects `post_install` tests only and requires module-scoped positive tags) |
| `get_environment_logs` | | Retrieve recent container logs |
| `run_odoo_command` | ✓ | Execute an arbitrary shell command inside the Odoo container (runs through `sh -c`, so pipes, redirections and `&&` work; `shell=False` for exact argv) |
| `run_odoo_shell` | ✓ | Execute Python code in the Odoo shell context with full ORM access; `auto_commit=True` commits successful writes, while `False` leaves the shell transaction uncommitted |
| `odoo_search_read` | ✓ | Search and read records (XML-RPC `search_read`/`search_count`) as any user, with ACLs and record rules applied |
| `odoo_create` | ✓ | Create one or many records (XML-RPC `create`). Committed immediately |
| `odoo_write` | ✓ | Update records (XML-RPC `write`). Committed immediately |
| `odoo_unlink` | ✓ | ⚠️ Delete records (XML-RPC `unlink`). Committed immediately, not recoverable |
| `odoo_call` | ✓ | Call public model methods not covered by the dedicated CRUD tools (`read_group`, `name_search`, `action_*`, …) |
| `odoo_schema` | ✓ | Page through models, or describe one model's fields (XML-RPC `fields_get`) |
| `read_file_in_odoo` | | Read a text file or list a directory inside the Odoo container. Supports line ranges (e.g. `"1:50"`) |
| `write_file_in_odoo` | ✓ | Write a text file inside the container (CSV imports, scripts, configs) |
| `search_in_odoo` | | Search for a pattern (fixed-string grep) in files inside the Odoo container |
| `http_request_to_odoo` | | Make an HTTP request to the running Odoo instance (test controllers, JSON-RPC, REST) |
| `list_installed_modules` | | List Odoo modules and their states with name/state filtering |
| `run_db_query` | ✓ | Execute SQL against the environment's PostgreSQL database; supports `output_format="csv"` or `"json"` and caps returned rows with `max_rows` (default `100`) |
| `reset_admin_password` | ✓ | Reset the admin user password in the Odoo database (default: "test") |
| `connect_as_user` | ✓ | Mint a passwordless Odoo login session for a user (by login or id) and return the `session_id` cookie + URL — hand to Playwright to skip the login form and test as any role (incl. portal) |
| `read_output` | | Read from a cached tool output by ID (paginate, grep, errors, tail) |
| **Template Management** | | |
| `save_as_template` | ✓ | ⚠️ Save a branch DB + filestore as a new template |
| `list_templates` | | List available template profiles, including the branch/commit each database snapshot was taken from |
| `delete_template` | ✓ | ⚠️ Delete a template profile (DB + files) |
| `rename_template` | ✓ | Rename a template (directory + PostgreSQL template DB); refused if any environment uses it |
| `import_template_from_odoo` | ✓ | Import a template from a running Odoo instance via database manager API; optional `without_filestore` requests a database-only PostgreSQL custom dump |
| `refresh_template` | ✓ | ⚠️ Re-apply a template's filestore to live overlay environments (preserves env changes by default; `reset_env_changes=True` discards them — destructive) |
| `attach_filestore` | ✓ | Attach or replace a template filestore from a local directory, archive, `rsync://` URL, or SSH rsync source; normalizes wrapper paths and preserves live env changes by default |
| **Auxiliary Services** | | |
| `create_service` | ✓ | Create a managed service with exactly one exposure model: catch-all `port`, or restricted Traefik `routes` (`path`, backend `port`, optional `strip_prefix`). The two parameters are mutually exclusive; `port` remains required outside Traefik |
| `delete_service` | ✓ | Stop and remove a service container |
| `restart_service` | | Restart a service container |
| `update_service` | ✓ | Preflight configuration, pull the latest image and/or change settings. `routes` replaces the complete allowlist; use `routes=[]` with `port` only when switching back to catch-all mode |
| `list_services` | | List all managed service containers |
| `get_service_info` | | Full live state of a single service (image+digest, port/routes, hostname, host_mode, volumes, env, capabilities, restart count, preset). Call before recreating it |
| `get_service_logs` | | Retrieve service container logs |
| `run_service_command` | | Execute a shell command inside a service container (through `sh -c`; `shell=False` for exact argv) |

| `write_file_in_volume` | ✓ | Write a text file inside a Docker volume |
| `search_in_volume` | | Search for a pattern (fixed-string grep) in files inside a Docker volume |
| `delete_file_in_volume` | ✓ | Delete a file or directory inside a Docker volume |
| **Service Presets** | | |
| `list_service_presets` | | List saved service presets (configurations that can be restored) |
| `restore_service` | ✓ | Restore a service from a saved preset |
| `delete_service_preset` | ✓ | Remove a saved service preset |
| **Repository Auth** | | |
| `setup_repo_auth` | ✓ | Cache git credentials for a private repository |

| `production_deploys` | | Read deploy history, including actions, modules, trigger, and rollback status |
| `production_logs` | | Read production Odoo logs with line, substring, and level filtering |
| `snapshot_production` | ✓ | Create an S3 snapshot containing the database, deduplicated filestore, and deployed commit |
| `list_production_snapshots` | | List S3 snapshots; `refresh=True` bypasses the cached index |
| `restore_production` | ✓ | Restore one production's database and filestore; requires its name in `confirm` |
| `production_backup_status` | | Inspect snapshot schedules, WAL archiving, base backups, and S3 reachability |

!!! info "Locking"
    Tools marked with ✓ acquire a per-branch or per-team lock. Operations on different branches run in parallel. If another operation on the **same branch** (or team, for team-level tools) is already in progress, the call is rejected with `BusyError`. The rejection names the operation holding the lock and how long it has held it (e.g. *"Another operation on environment 'main' (pull_and_apply, running for 4m12s) is in progress"*), so a long install is distinguishable from a hung one. A lock is released when its operation finishes — including when the client that started it timed out and stopped waiting, which is why restarting the environment is the wrong response.

The exact current signature and defaults for every tool are also available from
`oduflow list` (`oduflow list --verbose` adds descriptions). The production
workflow and disaster-recovery consequences are covered in
[Production Hosting](production.md).
