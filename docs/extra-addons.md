# Extra Addons Repositories

![Extra Addons Dashboard](img/extra_addons.png)

Oduflow supports mounting **extra addon repositories** (e.g. Odoo Enterprise,
third-party themes) into environments. Git objects and immutable checkouts are
shared by all development environments in a team.

## Architecture

```
{data_dir}/team_{ID}/
  shared_repos/
    enterprise/          ← bare git clone (shared)
    custom-themes/       ← bare git clone (shared)
  shared_extra_checkouts/
    enterprise/
      a1b2c3.../          ← immutable checkout of one commit (shared)
    custom-themes/
      d4e5f6.../          ← immutable checkout of one commit (shared)
  workspaces/
    feature-x/
      repo/              ← main project repo (existing)
```

The requested branch selects a commit when an environment is created. Several
environments on the same commit mount the same checkout read-only, without
duplicating its files. Checkouts are keyed by commit rather than branch because
branches move; an environment stays isolated on its current revision until it
is explicitly synced.

Production deployments retain private worktrees because their deploy engine
records and resets each worktree HEAD during rollback.

## Setting Up Extra Repos

Clone an extra repository once (it will be available for all environments):

```bash
# Via CLI
oduflow call add_extra_repo enterprise https://github.com/odoo/enterprise.git

# Private repos — configure auth first
oduflow call setup_repo_auth https://user:PAT@github.com/odoo/enterprise.git
oduflow call add_extra_repo enterprise https://github.com/odoo/enterprise.git
```

## Using Extra Addons in Environments

When creating an environment, specify which extra repos to mount:

```bash
# Mount enterprise addons on branch 19.0
oduflow call create_environment feature-x "" default https://github.com/company/addons.git odoo:19.0 "enterprise:19.0"

# Mount multiple extra repos
oduflow call create_environment feature-x "" default https://github.com/company/addons.git odoo:19.0 "enterprise:19.0,custom-themes:main"
```

For each development environment Oduflow automatically:

1. Fetches the specified branch and resolves its current commit SHA
2. Creates or reuses the team's immutable checkout for that SHA
3. Mounts the checkout **read-only** as `/mnt/extra-addons-{name}`
4. Generates a merged `odoo.conf` with all extra paths added to `addons_path`

## Managing Extra Repos

```bash
# List all cloned extra repos with available branches
oduflow call list_extra_repos

# Delete an extra repo (fails if any environment references it)
oduflow call delete_extra_repo enterprise
```

Extra repos can also be managed from the **Web Dashboard** under the "Extra Addons" tab.

## Protecting Extra Repos

Extra addon repositories can be **protected** from accidental deletion, similar to [environment protection](environments.md#environment-protection). A protected repo cannot be deleted until protection is removed.

Protection state is stored as a `.protected` marker file in the bare repository directory.

### Via REST API

```bash
# Protect an extra repo
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/extra-repos/enterprise/protect

# Unprotect an extra repo
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/extra-repos/enterprise/unprotect
```

### Via Web Dashboard

Extra repo protection can be toggled from the **Extra Addons** tab in the Web Dashboard. When protected:

- The **Delete** button is disabled
- Attempting to delete via API returns a `ProtectedError`

## Updating Extra Repos

Use `update_extra_repo` to fetch the latest changes from the remote:

```bash
oduflow call update_extra_repo enterprise
```

This runs `git fetch --all --prune` on the **shared bare repository** only. It
does **not** change the checkout mounted by any running environment.

### Updating an environment

Run the normal sync operation:

```bash
oduflow call pull_and_apply feature-x
```

`pull_and_apply` fetches every configured extra-addons branch, creates or reuses
the new SHA checkout, classifies its changed files, switches only that
environment's read-only mount, and performs the required install, upgrade, or
restart. Other environments continue using their previous checkout.

Cached checkouts are deliberately not reference-counted or removed with an
environment. Deleting the extra repository removes its bare clone and every
cached revision after Oduflow verifies that no environment or production still
depends on it.
