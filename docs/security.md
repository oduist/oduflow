# Authentication & Security

## MCP HTTP Auth

When `auth_token` is set for a team in `oduflow.toml`, the MCP endpoint (`/mcp`) requires a Bearer token:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
```

Each team can have its own auth token:

```toml
[team.1]
auth_token = "secret-token-team-1"

[team.2]
auth_token = "secret-token-team-2"
```

The token is used to both authenticate and identify the team. This is implemented via FastMCP's `StaticTokenVerifier`.

Fresh configs get a generated `auth_token` for `[team.1]` on first startup. The
value is printed in the startup log and stored in `oduflow.toml`; use it as
`Authorization: Bearer <auth_token>` when connecting HTTP MCP clients.

## Self-hosted OAuth (for Claude.ai and other MCP clients)

Oduflow can act as its own OAuth 2.1 Authorization Server, so MCP clients that require an OAuth flow (e.g. Claude.ai Remote MCP, MCP Inspector) can connect without any external identity provider.

The team's OAuth **`client_id`** is a non-secret identifier, `team_<id>` (e.g. `team_1` for `[team.1]`); the **`client_secret`** is the team's `auth_token`. Only the `client_id` appears in the authorization URL — the secret is sent solely in the token request body, so it never leaks into logs or browser history. When the OAuth flow completes, Oduflow issues an **independent, opaque access token that expires** (with a refresh token to obtain a new one) — the client never receives the `auth_token` itself, so a compromised OAuth token has a bounded lifetime and can be revoked. The `auth_token` stays valid as a plain Bearer token for CLI clients (see [Bearer-only mode](#bearer-only-mode-cli-automation)).

### Setup

**In [traefik mode](traefik.md) it's automatic.** The Authorization Server is enabled out of the box and runs on **each team's own hostname** — the OAuth issuer is derived per request from the incoming host (which already has a Let's Encrypt certificate). Just give each team an `auth_token`; no `oauth_base_url` is needed:

```toml
[routing]
mode = "traefik"
acme_email = "admin@example.com"

[team.1]
hostname = "team-a.example.com"
auth_token = "secret-token-team-1"
```

**In port mode** (no per-team TLS host), set `oauth_base_url` to the public https URL where this instance is reachable, so the issuer is a fixed, reachable endpoint:

```toml
[oauth]
oauth_base_url = "https://your-server.com"

[team.1]
auth_token = "secret-token-team-1"
```

Either way, Oduflow exposes:

- `GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` — discovery metadata
- `GET /authorize` — authorization endpoint (Authorization Code + PKCE)
- `POST /token` — token endpoint (mints/rotates the access + refresh token pair)
- `POST /revoke` — revoke a minted access or refresh token

Dynamic Client Registration (`/register`) is **disabled** — clients must use the preregistered credentials.

### Connecting from Claude.ai

1. Go to Claude.ai Settings → Connectors → Add custom MCP
2. Enter your Oduflow URL: `https://your-server.com/mcp` (in traefik mode, the team's own hostname, e.g. `https://team-a.example.com/mcp`)
3. In the OAuth fields, use the team's id as `Client ID` and its `auth_token` as `Client Secret` (the `Client ID` is `team_<N>` for `[team.N]` — e.g. `team_1` for `[team.1]`):

   ```
   Client ID     = team_1
   Client Secret = secret-token-team-1
   ```

4. Claude.ai performs the OAuth flow against your Oduflow instance, receives an access token, and connects.

The issued access token is an independent, expiring token bound to that team (not the `auth_token`), so each team's claude.ai connector ends up scoped to its own workspaces, templates, and credentials while Claude never stores the master secret. Claude.ai transparently uses its refresh token to obtain a new access token when the old one expires; the connection also survives an Oduflow restart because minted tokens are persisted.

### Bearer-only mode (CLI / automation)

For curl, IDE clients, or anything that doesn't need OAuth, simply send the `auth_token` as a Bearer header:

```
Authorization: Bearer secret-token-team-1
```

This works whether or not `oauth_base_url` is configured.

The built-in remote CLI uses the same Bearer authentication and live MCP tool
schemas:

```bash
export ODUFLOW_MCP_URL="https://your-server.com/mcp"
export ODUFLOW_MCP_TOKEN="secret-token-team-1"

oduflow client list_environments
```

`oduflow client` does not use the dashboard's `ui_password`. For an automation
that needs only one development environment, prefer its scoped `/mcp/<env>` URL
and per-environment Secret Key instead of the team token. The server then hides
team-wide tools and injects the environment target itself.

## Scoped single-environment access (`/mcp/<env>`)

The team `auth_token` unlocks the **full** tool surface — create, delete, and stop
environments, manage templates, services, and volumes. To hand an AI agent a
*confined* handle to one environment only, Oduflow exposes a scoped endpoint:

```
https://your-server.com/mcp/<env>
```

On this endpoint only the in-environment tools are available — sync
(`pull_and_apply`), install/upgrade modules, run tests, open the Odoo shell, run
SQL, read and write records through the `odoo_*` ORM tools, read/write/search
files, fetch logs and info, and `restart`. The ORM tools grant no new privilege:
anything they can reach is already reachable through `run_odoo_shell` and
`run_db_query`, which the endpoint has always exposed. Lifecycle and
system tools (create/delete/stop/start/recreate, templates, services, volumes,
listing other environments) are **not exposed and cannot be called**. The
environment is taken from the URL, so the agent never passes — and cannot
override — which environment it operates on.

### Per-environment Secret Key

Every environment created after this feature gets its own access token, generated
at creation time and stored on the container. Use it as a **Bearer token** or as
an **OAuth** client credential — exactly like a team `auth_token`, but it only
unlocks its own `/mcp/<env>` endpoint:

```
Authorization: Bearer <environment-secret-key>
```

A per-environment token is rejected on the full `/mcp` endpoint and on any other
environment's URL, so the credential itself is the boundary.

### Getting the URL and Secret Key

In the web dashboard, open an environment's **More → MCP Access**. The dialog
shows the `/mcp/<env>` URL and the Secret Key (with copy buttons) ready to paste
into an agent's MCP configuration or the built-in remote CLI:

```bash
export ODUFLOW_MCP_URL="https://your-server.com/mcp/<env>"
export ODUFLOW_MCP_TOKEN="<environment-secret-key>"
oduflow client get_environment_info
```

Environments created before this feature carry no Secret Key (Docker labels can't
be added to a live container); recreate the environment to issue one. Recreating
an environment also rotates its token.

## Web Dashboard Auth

The browser login form creates a signed, seven-day HTTP-only session cookie.
The REST API also accepts HTTP Basic authentication. Both use a **separate**
password:

- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: value of `ui_password` from `oduflow.toml`

This is independent from the MCP Bearer token (`auth_token`). Credentials are
compared using `hmac.compare_digest` to prevent timing attacks. State-changing
cookie-auth requests and WebSocket handshakes are additionally checked for a
same-origin `Origin`/`Referer` to prevent CSRF.

Fresh configs get a generated `ui_password` for `[team.1]` on first startup.
Older HTTP configs with an empty `ui_password` are also auto-filled on startup
and written back to `oduflow.toml`, so an upgrade does not expose the dashboard.

## When auth is disabled

MCP auth and Web UI auth are configured independently per team:

- If `auth_token` is empty, the MCP endpoint has no team Bearer token
- If `ui_password` is empty, the web dashboard has no login password

In HTTP mode, Oduflow refuses to start with an unauthenticated MCP endpoint or
dashboard unless the operator explicitly sets:

```toml
[server]
allow_insecure_http = true
```

Use that only behind your own authenticating proxy. In normal fresh HTTP
deployments, `auth_token` and `ui_password` are generated automatically and
startup logs show auth as enabled:

```
INFO  [team.1] http://localhost:8000/ (MCP token ON, OAuth OFF, UI auth ON)
```

When OAuth is enabled the status reads `OAuth ON (self-hosted)`.

## Git Credentials

![Credentials Management](img/credentials.png)

Private repository credentials are stored in the git credential store at `{team_data_dir}/.git-credentials` (per-team) via the `setup_repo_auth` tool. The clean URL (without credentials) is always used in Docker labels and logs — credentials are never exposed.

### Managing credentials via MCP

```bash
# Store credentials for a private repository
oduflow call setup_repo_auth https://user:PAT@github.com/owner/private-repo.git
```

The tool parses the URL, stores the credentials, and verifies access by running `git ls-remote`.

### Managing credentials via REST API and Web Dashboard

The Web Dashboard and REST API provide full credential lifecycle management:

| Action | REST API |
|---|---|
| **List** all stored credentials | `GET /api/credentials` |
| **Add** credentials for a repository | `POST /api/credentials/add` (body: `repo_url`) |
| **Delete** a stored credential | `POST /api/credentials/delete` (body: `host`, `username`) |
| **Validate** a credential against the provider | `POST /api/credentials/validate` (body: `host`, `username`) |

Validation checks the credential against the provider's API (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket). For other hosts, it reports `"valid"` if the credential exists. Tokens are always masked in API responses (e.g. `ghp_****`).

## iptables rule

On startup, an `iptables ACCEPT` rule is automatically added for the `oduflow-net` Docker bridge interface. This ensures that containers on the shared network can communicate with the host (required for Traefik `host.docker.internal` routing and PostgreSQL access). If `iptables` is not available, the rule is skipped with a warning.

## Odoo security defaults

The bundled `odoo.conf` template includes these security settings:

- `list_db = False` (hides database selector)
- `without_demo = all` (no demo data)
- `max_cron_threads = 0` (disables cron in dev environments)

A repository that ships its own `.oduflow/odoo.conf` replaces the template
entirely and is responsible for these settings itself.
