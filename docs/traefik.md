# Traefik Routing (Auto-HTTPS)

By default Oduflow uses **port mode**: each environment gets a dedicated host port (e.g. `http://server:50001`). This is simple and works well for local or single-developer setups.

For production-like access with HTTPS, Oduflow can deploy a **Traefik** reverse proxy that gives every environment its own subdomain with an automatically issued Let's Encrypt certificate.

## Setup

1. **Configure a wildcard DNS record.** Point `*.dev.example.com` to your server's IP address:

   ```
   *.dev.example.com  →  A  →  203.0.113.10
   ```

   Every environment will get a subdomain: `feature-login.dev.example.com`, `fix-invoice.dev.example.com`, etc.

2. **Set the configuration** in `oduflow.toml`:

   ```toml
   [routing]
   mode = "traefik"
   acme_email = "admin@example.com"

   [team.1]
   hostname = "dev.example.com"
   environment_slots = 20
   environment_hostname_mode = "branch"
   ```

3. **Start (or restart) Oduflow.** On startup, Oduflow will create a Traefik v3 container that:
   - Listens on ports 80 and 443
   - Automatically redirects HTTP to HTTPS
   - Obtains a TLS certificate from Let's Encrypt for each routed hostname via HTTP-01 challenge
   - Routes requests to the correct Odoo container based on the subdomain
   - Also routes the Oduflow server itself via the team `hostname`

## Hostname and certificate strategies

The default `environment_hostname_mode = "branch"` keeps descriptive and
backward-compatible routes: `feature-login.dev.example.com`,
`fix-invoice.dev.example.com`, and so on. `environment_slots = 20` limits how
many environments may exist but does not change those names. This mode matches
the `*.dev.example.com` DNS record shown above and works with a Cloudflare or
other wildcard certificate for `*.dev.example.com`.

For Traefik HTTP-01 installations that need to bound Let's Encrypt issuance,
opt into a reusable pool:

```toml
[team.1]
hostname = "dev.example.com"
environment_slots = 20
environment_hostname_mode = "slots"
```

Oduflow then allocates `dev1.example.com` through `dev20.example.com` and
returns names to the pool on deletion. These names are one DNS level higher
than branch-derived routes: configure individual `dev1`…`dev20` records or a
wildcard record for `*.example.com`. A `*.dev.example.com` record or certificate
does not cover `dev1.example.com`.

`create_environment(hostname="qa")` requests `qa.example.com` in either mode.
The configured team hostname must include a distinct prefix
(`dev.example.com`, not bare `example.com`) for pooled or explicit short names.

## OAuth on each team's hostname

In traefik mode the self-hosted [OAuth Authorization Server](security.md#self-hosted-oauth-for-claudeai-and-other-mcp-clients) is enabled **automatically** and runs on **each team's own hostname** — the OAuth issuer is derived per request from the incoming host, which already has a Let's Encrypt certificate. You do **not** need to set `oauth_base_url`: point Claude.ai at `https://<team-hostname>/mcp` and complete the OAuth flow there.

## Service routing with Traefik

Auxiliary services also get Traefik routing. A service named `meilisearch` with base domain `dev.example.com` becomes accessible at `https://meilisearch.dev.example.com`. Custom hostnames are also supported.

## Routing extra domains to external services

Traefik in Oduflow can also forward a domain to a service that Oduflow does
**not** manage — another Docker container, a process on the host, or a machine
elsewhere. There are two ways, from simplest to most flexible.

### 1. Declarative routes in `oduflow.toml`

For the common "this hostname → that URL" case, add a `[route.<name>]` section:

```toml
[routing]
mode = "traefik"
acme_email = "admin@example.com"

[team.1]
hostname = "dev.example.com"

[route.legacy-api]
host = "api.example.com"
url  = "http://127.0.0.1:3000"
```

On the next start Oduflow generates a Traefik router for `api.example.com` and
forwards it to `http://127.0.0.1:3000`. In TLS mode the route gets its own
Let's Encrypt certificate (point the domain's DNS at this server first), exactly
like a team hostname; behind a `tls = false` upstream it is served over plain
HTTP on port 80.

Notes:

- **`127.0.0.1` / `localhost` mean "on the Docker host".** Traefik runs in a
  container, so Oduflow rewrites an `http://` loopback upstream to
  `host.docker.internal` (mapped to the host gateway). So `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
  reaches a service listening on port 3000 of the host. Use the real IP/hostname
  for anything off the host. An `https://localhost` upstream is **not** rewritten
  (that would break backend TLS certificate verification) — for a TLS backend on
  the host, use its real hostname or a drop-in dynamic file with a
  `serversTransport`.
- `url` must be `http://…` or `https://…`; `host` must be a plain hostname (no
  path) and unique across all routes and team hostnames.
- These routes are declared once in config; the generated router set is
  rewritten on every restart, so hand-editing the generated file is pointless
  (use option 2 for custom Traefik config).

### 2. Drop-in Traefik dynamic files

For anything the simple `host → url` form can't express — middleware, header
rewrites, custom TLS options, sticky sessions, multiple services — Oduflow
mounts a **dynamic-config directory** that Traefik watches:

- On the host it is `<config-dir>/traefik-dynamic/` — `/etc/oduflow/traefik-dynamic/`
  when writable, otherwise `~/.oduflow/conf/traefik-dynamic/`.
- Oduflow writes and overwrites only `oduflow.yml` there (its own routers). Any
  **other** `*.yml`/`*.yaml`/`*.toml` file you place in that directory is loaded
  by Traefik and **never touched by Oduflow** — it survives restarts and
  upgrades.

For example, `<config-dir>/traefik-dynamic/custom.yml`:

```yaml
http:
  routers:
    my-app:
      rule: "Host(`app.example.com`)"
      entryPoints: ["websecure"]
      tls:
        certResolver: letsencrypt
      service: my-app
      middlewares: ["my-headers"]
  middlewares:
    my-headers:
      headers:
        customRequestHeaders:
          X-Forwarded-Proto: "https"
  services:
    my-app:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: "http://host.docker.internal:9000"
```

Traefik picks it up within a second (no restart needed). This is the full
Traefik [file-provider dynamic configuration](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/providers/file/),
so use it when you outgrow the declarative routes above.

## Behind a Cloudflare tunnel (or other TLS-terminating upstream)

If HTTPS is terminated upstream — for example by a **Cloudflare tunnel** (`cloudflared`) that already serves a valid certificate — Traefik should not obtain its own certificates or redirect to HTTPS. Set `tls = false`:

```toml
[routing]
mode = "traefik"
tls = false          # Traefik listens on plain HTTP :80 only

[team.1]
hostname = "dev.example.com"
```

With `tls = false` Traefik:

- Listens on **port 80 only** (443 is not published), serving plain HTTP.
- Does **not** redirect HTTP→HTTPS and does **not** request Let's Encrypt certificates (`acme_email` is not required).
- Routes by the same `Host` rules as before, so each environment keeps its own subdomain.

Point the tunnel at the server's port 80 and route the wildcard hostname to it (e.g. `*.dev.example.com → http://localhost:80`). Cloudflare provides the certificate and forwards requests over HTTP; the tunnel sets `X-Forwarded-Proto: https`. On the `web` entrypoint Oduflow enables `forwardedHeaders.insecure` so Traefik passes those headers through (by default Traefik would overwrite `X-Forwarded-Proto` with the plain-HTTP connection scheme), letting Oduflow see the request as secure — the dashboard's session cookie stays `Secure` and every environment/service URL Oduflow reports is still `https://…`. Because this entrypoint trusts all forwarded headers, expose port 80 **only** to the tunnel, not to the public internet.

> **Changing `tls` on a running deployment recreates Traefik but not your environments.** Each environment and service bakes its Traefik routing labels in at creation time — `entrypoints=websecure` (with Let's Encrypt) when `tls = true`, `entrypoints=web` when `tls = false`. Restarting Oduflow recreates the Traefik container in the new mode, but pre-existing environments and services keep their old labels: after the switch their routers point at an entrypoint that no longer matches, so they become unreachable until **recreated** (or, going `false → true`, get caught by the HTTP→HTTPS redirect). Treat `tls` as a deploy-time choice; if you must flip it on a live server, recreate the existing environments and services afterwards. The default is `tls = true` (Traefik terminates TLS with Let's Encrypt, as described above).

## Plain HTTP, with nothing terminating TLS

`tls = false` on its own means "**someone else** terminates TLS", so the links
Oduflow hands out — environment and service URLs, dashboard share links, MCP
endpoints — stay `https://`. If there is no such upstream (a LAN box, an
internal staging server, a local demo), those links point at an endpoint nobody
serves. Say so explicitly with `public_scheme`:

```toml
[routing]
mode = "traefik"
tls = false
public_scheme = "http"   # no TLS anywhere: hand out http:// links

[team.1]
hostname = "dev.example.com"
```

`public_scheme` sets the scheme of every URL Oduflow reports; it defaults to
`https` in traefik mode and `http` in port mode, and is independent of `tls`
(which only decides whether *Traefik* terminates TLS). It also switches off
`forwardedHeaders.insecure` on the `web` entrypoint: with no trusted terminator
in front, that entrypoint is directly reachable and must not believe a
client-supplied `X-Forwarded-Proto`.

Changing `public_scheme` recreates the Traefik container (the forwarded-headers
argument changes) but not your environments — only the reported URLs change, so
no environment or service needs recreating.
