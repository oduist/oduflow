#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Create/refresh one environment's working checkout inside the team's agent
# container. Invoked from the env_ops create hook via `docker exec`. Idempotent.
#
# Usage: clone-env.sh REPO_URL BRANCH SLUG [MCP_URL] [GIT_USER]
#   REPO_URL    origin repo URL (no embedded creds; git creds are wired globally)
#   BRANCH      branch to check out
#   SLUG        filesystem-safe env slug; checkout goes to /workspace/<SLUG>
#   MCP_URL     this environment's SCOPED Oduflow MCP endpoint (/mcp/<env>;
#               optional; enables the Oduflow entry in Claude's .mcp.json)
#   GIT_USER    commit author for this checkout (optional; global default otherwise)
#
# No token argument on purpose: nothing secret is ever written to the checkout.
# .mcp.json references ${ODUFLOW_MCP_TOKEN}, which each console/chat session
# injects into its own `docker exec` environment with the per-environment
# scoped token (see web_ui.ws_agent_console / ws_agent_acp).
#
# Full clone (not --depth 1): the agent commits and pushes. The checkout lives on
# the persistent workspace volume, so it survives container recreation and every
# other environment's checkout is visible under /workspace for cross-branch reads.
